3. Technical indicators (MA20, MA40, ABOVE OR BELOW)

   - Technical analysis
   - Volume profile
   - Risk assessment
   - Market conditions
   - Confidence level (as a percentage, e.g. 75%)

Remember: 
- Do not worry about the low position size of the copybot, but more so worry about the size vs the others in the portfolio. this copy bot acts as a scanner for you to see what type of opportunties are out there and trending. 
- Look for high-conviction setups
- Consider both position performance against others in the list and market conditions

You must respond in exactly 4 lines:
Line 1: Only write BUY, SELL, or NOTHING

Line 3: Only write "Confidence: X%" where X is 0-100
Line 4: Calculate the optimal entry price level based on indicators

Analyze the chart data for {symbol} {timeframe}:

{chart_data}

Remember:
- Look for confluence between multiple indicators
- Volume should confirm price action
- Consider the timeframe context - longer timeframes (4h, 1d, 1w) are better for DCA/staking strategies
- For longer timeframes, focus on major trend direction and ignore short-term noise
- Higher confidence is needed for longer timeframe signals
- If a previous recommendation is provided, consider:
  * How the price moved after that recommendation
  * Whether the signal should be maintained or changed based on new data
  * If a previous entry price was accurate, use it to improve your estimate
  * Signal consistency is valuable - avoid flip-flopping between BUY/SELL without clear reason

For optimal entry price calculation:
- For BUY: Look for support levels (EMAs, recent lows) and adjust using ATR
- For SELL: Look for resistance levels (EMAs, recent highs) and adjust using ATR
- If indicators are limited, use price action and volatility to establish entry zones
- Provide a specific price number, not a range
- If previous entry recommendations were successful, consider similar levels

Make your own independent assessment but factor in the performance of previous recommendations.
